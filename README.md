# -ESP32-Water-Quality-Monitoring-TDS-EC-Temperature-
This project uses an ESP32, DS18B20 temperature sensor, and a TDS sensor to measure water quality parameters including:  ✅ TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) in ppm  ✅ EC (Electrical Conductivity) in mS/cm  ✅ Temperature in °C and °F

The values are:
Displayed on an SSD1306 OLED
Hosted on a web server accessible via ESP32’s static IP
Continuously updated every 2 seconds
